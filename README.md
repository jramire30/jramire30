I currently work as a Programmatic Analyst at Ziff Davis’ Everyday Health Group in NYC, where I use data to drive insights and optimize digital strategy. My academic background is in Economics and Finance (B.A., 2018), which gave me a strong foundation in quantitative reasoning and problem solving.

I’m currently enrolled in the BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp (Sept 2025 – Mar 2026), where I’m actively building and refining my skills in:

 - Python (data analysis, visualization, and machine learning)
 - SQL (querying, joins, data cleaning, business intelligence)
 - Statistics & Probability for data-driven decision making
 - Machine Learning (model building, evaluation, and deployment)

My long-term aspiration is to transition into a Data Scientist role where I can combine my analytical background, business knowledge, and technical toolkit to solve complex problems and build impactful data solutions.

🌱 What I’m Working On

 - Strengthening my Python fundamentals and SQL querying.
 - Building a portfolio of data projects to showcase my skills.
 - Learning best practices in data visualization and communication.
 - Exploring machine learning applications in real-world datasets.

🎯 Goals

 - Successfully complete BrainStation by March 2026 and leverage my new skills to land a Data Scientist role within the next 1–2 years.
 - Contribute to projects that merge business insights with advanced analytics.
 - Keep growing as a problem-solver and share my learning journey along the way.
